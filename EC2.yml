# The only required property in a CloudFormation document is Resources
# Everything else is optional

Description: "Example EC2 Set-up"

# Paramaters are referenced using the Ref property
# e.g. Ref: "KeyName"
#
# Parameters can be assigned a default value, but if not then the value
# needs to be provided when uploading the CloudFormation.
# If uploading via CLI then you'll provide a --parameters flag
# If uploading via the AWS console, a GUI will be provided
Parameters:
  KeyName:
    Description: "Name of an existing EC2 KeyPair to enable SSH access to the instance"
    Type: "String"

# Mappings allow us to map a key to a corresponding set of named values
# So if our instance is brought up in the eu-west-1 region we can use
# AWS::Region to tell us the current zone and then use the intrinsic function
# Fn::FindInMap to return the relevant matched value
Mappings:
  RegionMap:
    eu-west-1:
      AMI:
        - "ami-47cefa33"

# When pushing this CloudFormation we need to provide the public half of our key-pair
# See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html
#
# Then when attempting to SSH into the instance we can provide the private half
# See https://gist.github.com/Integralist/438898d6164daebec0c9
